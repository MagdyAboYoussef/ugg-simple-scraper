This project is a simple selenium tool that scrapes data (champions played,wins and losses) from last 50 games of a player aswell as ranks, it works for multiple regions and can use op.gg links for easier access

## How to use
to use it we press on "+" to add a place to type in the name of users we'll search for and (as many as we want the program is resizable) and name the excel file we want (ex 1) and decide which checks we want 
### Invisible :
runs the program in the background without any visualization 
### Update : 
updates the u.gg profile first before scraping (has 6 seconds delay on each profile so a bit slower)
### Ranked:
Only filters the ranked games (has 4.5 seconds delay on each profile).
